// Package retry provides a reusable retry engine and delay policies.
//
// 1. An Engine instance created with NewEngine is immutable after initialization
// and supports concurrent Run calls from multiple goroutines.
// 2. Run does not synchronize user-provided callbacks/policies and does not make them thread-safe.
// 3. If DelayPolicy, IsRetryable, Sleeper, Operation, or OnRetry are shared across goroutines,
// caller code must provide safe concurrent access to them.
// 4. Request is intended for a single Run call and must not be mutated concurrently.
// 5. In EngineConfig.MaxRetries, a value of 0 means unlimited retries.
