A distributed emergency shutdown system designed to quickly and safely power down all office computers when a hungry tiger enters the building elevator and threatens to reach the office floor.

## üêÖ Emergency Scenarios

### **Primary Threat: Elevator Tiger Incident**

When wildlife experts detect a hungry tiger has entered the building elevator, office safety protocols require immediate evacuation. This system ensures all computers are safely powered down to prevent data loss and equipment damage during the emergency evacuation.

### **Additional Tiger Threat Scenarios**

**üö™ Tiger Stuck in Revolving Door**

- Tiger enters revolving door but gets confused by the rotation mechanism
- Keeps going in circles for 10 minutes while growing increasingly frustrated
- Security realizes the situation when they hear rhythmic growling every 30 seconds
- Emergency shutdown prevents tiger from learning how doors work

**‚òï Tiger in Office Kitchen**  

- Tiger discovers the coffee machine and becomes highly caffeinated
- Starts frantically pressing alarm buttons while jittery from espresso
- Attempts to use microwave but can't figure out the timer
- System activates when tiger accidentally triggers motion sensors while doing coffee-induced zoomies

**üñ®Ô∏è Tiger vs. Printer Jam**

- Tiger somehow gets into the office and immediately encounters paper jam
- Becomes enraged at paper feeding mechanism (relatable)
- Starts shredding printer manual with claws while printer keeps beeping
- System detects unusual paper shredding patterns and activates emergency protocols

**üóÇÔ∏è Tiger Filing Tax Documents**

- Tiger breaks into accounting department during tax season
- Attempts to organize receipts but lacks opposable thumbs
- Gets increasingly frustrated with Excel spreadsheets
- Emergency shutdown prevents tiger from discovering the horrors of corporate bureaucracy

**üéµ Tiger Karaoke Emergency**

- Tiger discovers office karaoke machine left over from Christmas party
- Starts howling along to "My Way" by Frank Sinatra at 3 AM
- Security cameras detect large feline attempting to hold microphone
- System activates to spare everyone from tiger's terrible singing

**üçï Tiger Food Delivery Confusion**

- Hungry tiger follows pizza delivery person into building
- Gets confused when pizza doesn't contain actual wildlife
- Starts investigating vending machines for more substantial prey
- Emergency protocols engage when tiger realizes office snacks are mostly carbs

**üì± Tiger Zoom Meeting Incident**

- Tiger accidentally joins all-hands meeting through open laptop
- Entire company sees large cat staring directly into webcam
- Tiger tilts head confused by dozens of tiny human faces on screen  
- Meeting participants can't tell if it's a very realistic virtual background
- System activates when someone finally realizes Steve from Accounting doesn't own a tiger

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with role-based executable distribution:

### Server Components (Central Control Room)

- **`alarm-server`** - Central gRPC server managing alarm state
- **`alarm-button-off`** - Resets the alarm state (tiger safely captured)
- **`alarm-packager`** - Prepares and distributes software updates

### Client Components (Office Workstations)

- **`alarm-button-on`** - Triggers the emergency alarm (tiger detected!)
- **`alarm-checker`** - Monitors alarm state and initiates shutdown when activated
- **`alarm-updater`** - Keeps client software up-to-date

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) build tool

#### Option 2: Build From Source (For Developers)

**Prerequisites:**

- Go 1.25 or later
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) build tool

**Installation:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oshokin/alarm-button.git
cd alarm-button

# Install development tools
task install:all

# Build all executables for your platform
task build
```

### Configuration

Create a configuration file `alarm-button-settings.yaml` (or let the system create defaults):

```yaml
server_addr: "control-room-server:8080"
update_folder: "https://updates.company.com/alarm-system/"
state_file: "alarm-button-state.json"
timeout: "30s"
```

## üì¶ Deployment

### Server Setup (Control Room)

1. **Download and extract the release for your server platform**
2. **Deploy the alarm server:**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - Uses defaults from alarm-button-settings.yaml
   ./alarm-server
   
   # Windows - Uses defaults from alarm-button-settings.yaml
   .\alarm-server.exe
   
   # OR override listen address
   ./alarm-server :8080           # Linux/macOS
   .\alarm-server.exe :8080       # Windows
   ```

3. **Set up update distribution:**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ./alarm-packager control-room-server:8080 /path/to/update/folder
   
   # Windows
   .\alarm-packager.exe control-room-server:8080 C:\path\to\update\folder
   ```

### Client Setup (Office Workstations)

1. **Download and extract the release for each client platform**
2. **Deploy the alarm checker (runs as service):**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - Uses server address from alarm-button-settings.yaml
   ./alarm-checker
   
   # Windows - Uses server address from alarm-button-settings.yaml
   .\alarm-checker.exe
   
   # OR override server address
   ./alarm-checker control-room-server:8080    # Linux/macOS
   .\alarm-checker.exe control-room-server:8080 # Windows
   ```

3. **Deploy the updater (runs periodically):**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ./alarm-updater client
   
   # Windows
   .\alarm-updater.exe client
   ```

4. **Place emergency button on desktop (MINIMAL ARGS FOR DESKTOP SHORTCUTS):**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - ZERO ARGUMENTS (reads config file)
   ./alarm-button-on
   
   # Windows - ZERO ARGUMENTS (reads config file)
   .\alarm-button-on.exe
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Emergency Activation

When any tiger scenario is detected in the building:

1. **Any employee can trigger the alarm:**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - ZERO ARGUMENTS (perfect for desktop shortcuts!)
   ./alarm-button-on
   
   # Windows - ZERO ARGUMENTS (perfect for desktop shortcuts!)
   .\alarm-button-on.exe
   ```

   **OR just double-click the desktop shortcut!**

2. **All office computers will automatically shutdown** within seconds as `alarm-checker` services detect the alarm state.

### **Scenario-Specific Activation Guidelines**

- **üö™ Revolving Door Tiger**: Activate while tiger is still spinning (gives you 10 minutes)
- **‚òï Caffeinated Tiger**: Activate immediately - coffee makes tigers unpredictable  
- **üñ®Ô∏è Printer Jam Tiger**: Wait until tiger finishes destroying printer (it's therapeutic for everyone)
- **üóÇÔ∏è Tax Document Tiger**: Activate before tiger discovers depreciation schedules
- **üéµ Karaoke Tiger**: Activate only if tiger attempts songs from musicals
- **üçï Pizza Tiger**: Activate after tiger realizes there's no meat on veggie supreme
- **üì± Zoom Tiger**: Activate when tiger tries to unmute itself

### Reset After Emergency

Once the tiger has been safely captured:

1. **Security personnel reset the alarm:**

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - ZERO ARGUMENTS (perfect for desktop shortcuts!)
   ./alarm-button-off
   
   # Windows - ZERO ARGUMENTS (perfect for desktop shortcuts!)
   .\alarm-button-off.exe
   ```

2. **Employees can safely power on their computers** and resume work.

# Linux/macOS - Start checker in debug mode (won't actually shutdown)
./alarm-checker -d localhost:8080 &

# Windows - Start checker in debug mode
start .\alarm-checker.exe -d localhost:8080

# Trigger alarm - Linux/macOS (ZERO ARGS - reads from config)
./alarm-button-on

# Trigger alarm - Windows (ZERO ARGS - reads from config)
.\alarm-button-on.exe

# Check logs - should show "Would shutdown now (debug mode)"
```

## üî® Development

### Semantic Versioning and Commit Messages

This project uses semantic versioning with automated releases. All commit messages must follow a specific format:

- **`fix:`** - Bug fixes (increments patch version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
- **`feat:`** - New features (increments minor version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)  
- **`major:`** - Breaking changes (increments major version: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

#### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve shutdown timeout on Windows"
git commit -m "feat: add authentication to gRPC server"
git commit -m "major: redesign API with breaking changes"
```

#### Setting Up Git Hooks

```bash
# Enable commit message validation (recommended)
task install:githooks

# Disable if needed
task remove:githooks
```

Once hooks are enabled, invalid commit messages will be rejected locally.

### Version Injection

The build system automatically detects semantic version tags and injects version information into binaries:

- **With tags**: `task build` creates versioned binaries (e.g., v1.4.2)
- **Without tags**: `task build` creates development binaries (no version injection)

To create a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0    # Creates semantic version tag
task build        # Now builds with version 1.0.0 injected
```

See the Build Tasks section for all available development commands.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Tasks

This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) as a build tool. Below are all available tasks:

### Core Development Tasks

```bash
task build                    # Build all project binaries
task clean                    # Remove all built binaries
task test                     # Run all tests with verbose output
task test:race                # Run tests with race detector enabled
task format                   # Format Go code using goimports
task generate                 # Generate protobuf code and format
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Executables have `.exe` extension
- Use `^` for line continuation in Command Prompt or `` ` `` in PowerShell
- Default paths: `C:\ProgramData\alarm\` for system-wide files
- Consider running as Windows Service for `alarm-checker`

### Linux

- No file extensions for executables
- Use `\` for line continuation in bash
- Default paths: `/var/lib/alarm/` for system-wide files
- Use systemd for service management
- Requires appropriate permissions for shutdown commands

### macOS

- Same as Linux for most operations
- Support for both Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- Use launchd for service management
- May require additional permissions for shutdown operations

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Network Security**: Use TLS for production deployments
- **Access Control**: Restrict who can trigger alarms via system permissions
- **State Persistence**: Alarm state survives server restarts
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Computers shutdown safely to prevent data loss
- **Update Security**: Verify checksums for all distributed updates
- **Cross-Platform**: Same security model applies to all supported platforms

## üöÄ Automated Releases

This project uses automated semantic versioning and releases:

### How It Works

1. **Commit with semantic prefix**: `fix:`, `feat:`, or `major:`
2. **Push to master**: GitHub Actions analyzes commits since last release
3. **Automatic version bump**: Script determines version increment
4. **Tag creation**: New semantic version tag is created (e.g., `v1.4.8`)
5. **Release build**: GoReleaser creates cross-platform binaries
6. **GitHub Release**: Assets are published automatically

### Release Types

- **Patch Release** (`fix:`): `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v1.0.1` (bug fixes)
- **Minor Release** (`feat:`): `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v1.1.0` (new features)
- **Major Release** (`major:`): `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v2.0.0` (breaking changes)

### Manual Release (if needed)

```bash
# Create and push a tag manually
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## üõ†Ô∏è IDE Support

### VSCode Debugging

The project includes comprehensive debugging configurations in `.vscode-example/launch.json`:

- **alarm-server** debugging (default and custom ports)
- **alarm-button-on/off** debugging (with safety debug flags)
- **alarm-checker** debugging (safe mode, no actual shutdown)
- **alarm-updater** debugging (client and server roles)
- **Integration tests** debugging
- **All-in-one scenarios** for complex testing

To use: Open VSCode, go to Run & Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D), and select any configuration.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Use semantic commits (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Add package documentation for all packages (`doc.go` files)
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Use semantic commit messages (`fix:`, `feat:`, `major:`)
- Run `task lint` before submitting
- All comments must start with a capital letter and end with a period

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Initial setup
git clone https://github.com/oshokin/alarm-button.git
cd alarm-button
task install:all          # Install all development tools
task install:githooks     # Enable commit message validation

git commit -m "feat: add new emergency notification system"
git push origin feature-branch
```

## üìã License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer

This software is designed for emergency situations involving hungry tigers entering office buildings via elevators and related feline workplace incidents.

### **Testing Methodology**

While we've tested extensively with simulated tiger scenarios using:

- Cardboard tiger cutouts (surprisingly effective)
- Employees wearing tiger costumes (less effective, caused different type of panic)
- Actual zoo tigers (discontinued after legal complications)
- CGI tigers (tigers were unimpressed by special effects)

**Actual tiger encounters may vary significantly.**

### **Known Limitations**

- System may not detect tigers wearing business casual attire
- False positives possible with very large orange cats
- Effectiveness reduced if tiger has completed IT training
- Does not account for tigers who have learned to use keycards
- Vegetarian tigers may not trigger hunger-based detection algorithms

### **Support Policy**

- **Tiger-related incidents**: Covered under standard warranty
- **Lion, leopard, or other big cats**: Please file bug report with species specification
- **Domestic cats acting like tigers**: Not covered (this is normal cat behavior)
- **Tigers successfully using office equipment**: Please contact our research department immediately

### **Emergency Protocols**

For non-tiger emergencies, consult your local emergency services.
For tiger emergencies involving:

- **Accounting software**: Contact your tax attorney
- **HR violations**: Tigers are not subject to corporate policy
- **Coffee machine malfunctions**: Priority Level 1 incident regardless of tiger presence

Please ensure your building has proper wildlife control measures in addition to this software solution.

---

## üêÖ **Final Notice**

**Remember**: In case of an actual hungry tiger emergency, prioritize personal safety over data backup procedures. The software will handle the technical aspects automatically.

*If a tiger is reading this documentation, please note that we have many delicious snacks in the break room and the computers taste terrible.*
